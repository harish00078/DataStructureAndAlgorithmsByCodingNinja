        //  i.e, we canâ€™t use it as an identifier. 
        // It is used to exit from a method, with or without a value. 
        // Usage of return keyword as there exist two ways as listed below as follows: 

        // Case 1: Methods returning a value
        // Case 2: Methods not returning a value

        // for example we use (check prime number program) to see how the return keyword works.
        /*
         * 1. like if i want to check that particular number that this number is prime or not.
         * 2. then we can use the return keyword.
         * 3. we use return keyword because we did not want that our loop will go from 1 to n(user input) number to check that the number is prime or not.
         * 4. that why we use return keyword.
         * 5. this will also work better in term of the space and time complexity. 
         * 6. beacuse it will directly check that the number is prime or not and end the code.

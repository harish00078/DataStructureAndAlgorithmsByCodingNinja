    // IN this print statement i have two errors:
    // 1. is for color property : because it private : here we can access the color using getcolor function.
    // because (getcolor) function is in the form of the public modifier.thats why we can use it any where.
    // 2. is for maxspeed : because we  did not access the default property also in the other package:
    // if i want to access the maxspeed property also in the other packages so have to convert it into public modifier.
    // or we can use the protected modifier:

    

    
// }
